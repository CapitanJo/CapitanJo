Hi, i'm Alexey ! 
small tlakk bout me:
I have a large list of hobbies from snowboarding and ping pong to blacksmithing, carpentry and programming single-board computers.
The most fascinating process for me is the search, generation of fresh ideas and solutions.
The pleasure of visualizing the solution you have implemented is difficult to compare with anything!

Now obviously one of the most promising professional areas is "It". With my love of analytics and statistics, the choice of a new professional environment is obvious. I climb to where I'm finally interested in getting and applying skills and knowledge!
